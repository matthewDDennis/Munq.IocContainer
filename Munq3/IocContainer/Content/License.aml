      <para>
      This project is released under the Microsoft Public License, the text
      of which is shown below.  Basically, you can do what you want with it, but 
      just keep the copyright notices in place.

      While I've spent a lot of effort try to catch all the bugs, some may still 
      be lurking.  Because of this, it is your responsibility to make sure that 
      Munq functions as you expect in your application, as you should with any 
      third party library.

        <para>This license governs use of the accompanying software. If you use 
        the software, you accept this license. If you do not accept the license, 
        do not use the software.</para>

1. Definitions

<para>The terms "reproduce," "reproduction," "derivative works," and "distribution" 
have the same meaning here as under U.S. copyright law.
</para>
<para>A "contribution" is the original software, or any additions or changes to 
the software.
</para>
<para>A "contributor" is any person that distributes its contribution under this 
license.
</para>
<para>"Licensed patents" are a contributor's patent claims that read directly on 
its contribution.
</para>
2. Grant of Rights

<para>(A) Copyright Grant- Subject to the terms of this license, including the 
license conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a 
non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce its 
contribution, prepare derivative works of its contribution, and distribute its 
contribution or any derivative works that you create.
</para>
<para>(B) Patent Grant- Subject to the terms of this license, including the 
license conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a 
non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license under its licensed patents to make, 
have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and/or otherwise dispose of its 
contribution in the software or derivative works of the contribution in the software.
</para>
3. Conditions and Limitations

<para>(A) No Trademark License- This license does not grant you rights to use 
any contributors' name, logo, or trademarks.
</para>
<para>(B) If you bring a patent claim against any contributor over patents that 
you claim are infringed by the software, your patent license from such contributor 
to the software ends automatically.
</para>
<para>(C) If you distribute any portion of the software, you must retain all 
copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices that are present in the software.
</para>
<para>(D) If you distribute any portion of the software in source code form, you may do so only under this license by including a complete copy of this license with your distribution. If you distribute any portion of the software in compiled or object code form, you may only do so under a license that complies with this license.
</para>
<para>(E) The software is licensed "as-is." You bear the risk of using it. The 
contributors give no express warranties, guarantees or conditions. You may have 
additional consumer rights under your local laws which this license cannot change. 
To the extent permitted under your local laws, the contributors exclude the 
implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and 
non-infringement. </para>
